# Compile Sass Files in Visual Studio and Webpack

.NET Core MVC base project with support for Sass using Webpack that includes minification and autoprefixing CSS for production.

Although this is a Core app, the same principles apply to a ASP.NET MVC app. You would just need to modify the Webpack configuration a little bit to output the CSS file to the `Content` directory.

## Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and NPM installed. You will also need [NPM Task Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.NPMTaskRunner).

## Usage

Open **_Command Prompt_**, clone this repo and cd into the project to install JavaScript dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/esausilva/netcore-sass-webpack.git
cd netcore-sass-webpack\netcore-sass-webpack
npm i
```

After installing dependencies, double click `netcore-sass-webpack.sln` to open the project in Visual Studio.
